# PointBeV-Optimized-Code-and-Detailed-Commentary

## What is PointBeV?
- PointBev is a SOTA BeV perception model.
- Below is a summary of this model.
 1. The authors proposed a Sparse Feature Pulling module
   1.1. This reduced the computations during traiing and inference.
2. Pulls Features from RGB feature maps using 3D coordinates.
3. Uses past frames by using Submanifold Attention module.

## Purpose of thie Repo
- The purpose of this repo is two-fold.
 1. This repository contains detailed comments to facilitate understanding.
 2. Optimized some of the original code for better efficiency without sacrificing performance.
